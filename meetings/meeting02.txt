- read papers
- notebook lm
- research a lot, notes, questions

In today's meeting, Rob sent me on some papers he found that are related to my topic for me to read and research further. Rob recommended to myself and Chris to use Google's Notebook LM to help with our research but feeding it any papers we have read and provide it with any information we come across about our projects so we can brainstorm ideas and keep track of the heaps of information we will be consuming. 
Our next meeting is scheduled online for October 29th @ 10:30am, and in the time before then I should research more, keeping in mind what we mentioned in our meeting today, taking notes and coming up with any questions to ask or spit ball on in the next meeting.
