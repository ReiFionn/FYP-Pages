Today I made the first few attempts at creating the base of the app after Supabase's downtime during this week. I attempted to use templates/boilerplates found on GitHub to speed up the process but ultimately decided against using them as I figured the app's would take longer to dismantle and tailor to what I want than just making the app from the ground up. 

I began by making an expo app and installing react native and supabase, configuring the connection between the app and my supabase cloud stuff. Next, I made a skeleton of the home page - taking inspiration from Vinted. The home page consists of a search bar, filtering options, listings, and buttons to go to the profile page, the messages page, or the search page (the search page will have more complex searching and filtering options that are absent from the home page). 

I've been having issues with the .env file, will resolve these soon. 

Attached are some simple notes I took while browsing on Vinted, as well as all the screens I will need:
