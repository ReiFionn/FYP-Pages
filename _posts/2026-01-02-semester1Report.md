Happy New Year!

I am just after uploading my completed semester 1 report for this project, and I am currently working on the presentation to go alongside it. I have some words I would like to share about this document and how I think I've done.

I wasn't very proud of the document when I went to submit it, I just did not think it was a good reflection to what I can do and the app itself. After recieving feedback from my supervisor, these feelings have been hightened. I'm hoping by the end of this to have a product I'm proud to show off.

I started created the document in LATeX on the website Overleaf, and had bought the pro version to be able to get more compile time. Soon after this purchase, I was informed on how you could set up a LATeX editor in VSCode so I cancelled my subscription and moved platform after a few hours of installation and set up. One piece of feedback I recieved was that the document has been written in US English, and this was because of the autocorrect on overleaf changing the spelling of words to the US English versions. 

The document itself has headings that were mentioned loosely in the project brief, as well as some extra bits that myself and my supervisor discussed. I feel like the document is messy and I'm not sure if there's enough substance in it.
